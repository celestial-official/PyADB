2. **Connect Device:** Connect your Android device to your computer via USB and enable USB debugging.

3. **Run Script:** Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `pyabd.py`, then execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python pyabd.py
   ```

4. **Follow Prompts:** Follow the prompts to select the connected device and enter the file path you want to transfer.

5. **Enjoy:** Sit back and watch as the script transfers the file to your device and opens it using a text viewer application.
